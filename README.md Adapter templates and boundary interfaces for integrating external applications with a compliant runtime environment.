A public-facing adapter boundary for a proprietary Business Intelligence Runtime.

This repository exposes **interfaces only**.
No runtime logic, memory systems, analytics, or learning mechanisms are included.

## Purpose
- Enable safe UI, Voice, and Agent integrations
- Protect internal decision engines
- Allow drop-in compatibility across environments

> This repository is intentionally non-executable.  
> All intelligence exists behind private runtimes.

This kit defines **adapter boundaries only**.

## Allowed
- Implement interfaces
- Route outputs to UI / Voice / Agent systems

## Not Allowed
- Reverse engineering runtime behavior
- Inferring analytics logic
- Extracting memory or prediction models

Adapters are one-way interfaces.  
They receive instructions — never expose origin logic.

If you can "see how it thinks", you integrated incorrectly.
