This repository provides adapter templates and boundary interfaces
for integrating external applications with a compliant runtime environment.

It is intended for interoperability testing, integration scaffolding,
and execution compatibility validation.

Internal runtime logic, memory systems, and proprietary implementations
are intentionally excluded.
