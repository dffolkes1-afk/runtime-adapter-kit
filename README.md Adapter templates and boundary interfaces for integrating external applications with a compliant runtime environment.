Runtime Adapter Kit for modular and autonomous systems.

This repository defines **public interface contracts only**.
It enables external systems to integrate with a compliant runtime
without exposing internal logic, memory mechanisms, or decision engines.

## What This Is
- Adapter interfaces
- Plugin boundary definitions
- Execution and inspection policies
- Configuration and capability schemas

## What This Is Not
- No runtime logic
- No memory systems
- No intelligence or inference
- No analytics or training components
- No internal state

## Design Principle
This repository exists solely as a **public boundary layer**.

All intelligence, memory, execution engines, and decision systems
exist in **private runtimes** and are not represented here.

## Intended Use
Use this kit to:
- Build compliant adapters
- Declare integration compatibility
- Validate configuration boundaries

Internal implementations may vary.

This kit defines **adapter boundaries only**.

## Allowed
- Implement interfaces
- Route outputs to UI / Voice / Agent systems

## Not Allowed
- Reverse engineering runtime behavior
- Inferring analytics logic
- Extracting memory or prediction models

Adapters are one-way interfaces.  
They receive instructions — never expose origin logic.

If you can "see how it thinks", you integrated incorrectly.
